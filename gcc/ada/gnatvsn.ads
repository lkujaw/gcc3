--  This package spec holds version information for the GNAT tools.
--  It is updated whenever the release number is changed..

package Gnatvsn is

   Gnat_Static_Version_String : constant String := "2006 (20060522-34)";
   --  Static string identifying this version, that can be used as an argument
   --  to e.g. pragma Ident.
   --
   --  WARNING: some scripts rely on the format of this string. Any change
   --  must be coordinated with the scripts requirements. Furthermore, no
   --  other variable in this package may have a name starting with
   --  Gnat_Version_String.

   function Gnat_Version_String return String;
   --  Version output when GNAT (compiler), or its related tools, including
   --  GNATBIND, GNATCHOP, GNATFIND, GNATLINK, GNATMAKE, GNATXREF, are run
   --  (with appropriate verbose option switch set).

   type Gnat_Build_Type is (Gnatpro, FSF, GPL);
   --  See Get_Gnat_Build_Type below for the meaning of these values

   function Get_Gnat_Build_Type return Gnat_Build_Type;
   --  This function returns one of the following values of
   --  Gnat_Build_Type:
   --
   --    FSF
   --       GNAT FSF version. This version of GNAT is part of a Free Software
   --       Foundation release of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The bug
   --       box generated by Comperr gives information on how to report bugs
   --       and list the "no warranty" information.
   --
   --    Gnatpro
   --       GNAT Professional version. This version of GNAT is supported by Ada
   --       Core Technologies. The bug box generated by package Comperr gives
   --       instructions on bug submission that include references to customer
   --       number, gnattracker site etc.
   --
   --    GPL
   --       GNAT GPL Edition. This is a special version of GNAT, released by
   --       Ada Core Technologies and intended for academic users, and free
   --       software developers. The bug box generated by the package Comperr
   --       gives appropriate bug submission instructions that do not reference
   --       customer number etc.

   Ver_Len_Max : constant := 32;
   --  Longest possible length for Gnat_Version_String in this or any
   --  other version of GNAT. This is used by the binder to establish
   --  space to store any possible version string value for checks. This
   --  value should never be decreased in the future, but it would be
   --  OK to increase it if absolutely necessary. If it is increased,
   --  be sure to increase GNAT.Compiler.Version.Ver_Len_Max as well.

   Library_Version : constant String := "2006";
   --  Library version. This value must be updated whenever any change to the
   --  compiler affects the library formats in such a way as to obsolete
   --  previously compiled library modules.
   --
   --  Note: Makefile.in relies on the precise format of the library version
   --  string in order to correctly construct the soname value.

   Verbose_Library_Version : constant String := "GNAT Lib v" & Library_Version;
   --  Version string stored in e.g. ALI files

   ASIS_Version_Number : constant := 17;
   --  ASIS Version. This is used to check for consistency between the compiler
   --  used to generate trees, and an ASIS application that is reading the
   --  trees. It must be updated (incremented) whenever a change is made to
   --  the tree format that would result in a compiler being incompatible with
   --  an older version of ASIS, or vice versa.

   Current_Year : constant String := "2006";
   --  Used in printing copyright messages

end Gnatvsn;
